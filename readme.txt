In its expanded state, this plugin holds an image, social media icons and any other information a developer or author deems 
appropriate.  The latest 2.0 release takes these already-popular features and supercharges them to create a richer experience

Developers also can use our inline CSS editor and a rollout speed setting to customize the user experience.  

Building on the great user interface XPandable Author Tab developers and users have come to expect, they now have access to 
video-based help and can receive free technical support via a built-in ticketing interface.
